# boardofstates
Kanban board for purpose of demonstration only... Check it out at boardofstates.firebaseapp.com

How does it work? Firebase provides serverless backend hosting, authentication, and database via Firestore with security rules. Frontend is designed with Vue.js.

How may I use it? Signup or login, then create a new board. Clicking on the board name will select it and unlock "todo", "doing" and "done" tabs. You can create new jobs under "todo" section. Clicking on a job will open its details. There you can switch it to "doing" or "done" sections, or delete it, or send comments for this job. Also you can add other users by their email address, thus let them use the same board together with you as a team.

Please note that, this project is made as a demonstration of my skills.

Thank you for stopping by.
